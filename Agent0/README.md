# Agent0: Unleashing Self-Evolving Agents from Zero Data via Tool-Integrated Reasoning

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2511.16043-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16043)

This repository is the official implementation of **Agent0**.

![](./figs/fig1.png)

**Agent0** is a fully autonomous framework that evolves high-performing agents from scratch without relying on any human-curated data. It employs a symbiotic competition between a **Curriculum Agent** (proposing tasks) and an **Executor Agent** (solving tasks with tools), driving a self-reinforcing cycle of improvement.

## 🔥 Key Features
* **Zero Data:** Eliminates dependency on external data or human annotations.
* **Co-Evolution:** Establishes a competition where the curriculum agent creates increasingly difficult tasks and the executor agent learns to solve them.
* **Tool Integration:** Integrates external tools (e.g., code interpreter) to enhance problem-solving and pressure the curriculum agent to generate complex, tool-aware tasks.

## 📊 Results
Empirically, Agent 0 substantially boosts reasoning capabilities on the Qwen3-8B-Base model:
* **+18%** improvement on Mathematical Reasoning benchmarks.
* **+24%** improvement on General Reasoning benchmarks.

## 🚀 Quickstart Guide

### 1. Configure Environment and Prepare Dirs
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aiming-lab/Agent0.git

cd Agent0/Agent0

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install -e verl
pip install "flash-attn==2.8.3" --no-build-isolation
```
### 2. Sandbox Service
You need to deploy a code sandbox service for subsequent code compilation. You can dynamically adjust the number or specific configuration of the sandbox service based on your hardware settings such as CPU memory to meet higher concurrency requirements. Please refer to [this](https://github.com/bytedance/SandboxFusion) for more details.

Here is a sample script for the sandbox setup. We deployed four sandbox services. Each service is assigned an IP address and a corresponding port.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bytedance/SandboxFusion.git

cd SandboxFusion
poetry install
make run-online
```

### 3. Train the Curriculum Agent
First, you need to fill out the code lines L36-41 with info of sandbox service from Step 2 in `curriculum_train/vllm_service_init/start_vllm_server_tool.py`.

```python
SANDBOX_API_URLS = [
    'IP1:PORT1/run_code',
    'IP2:PORT2/run_code',
    'IP3:PORT3/run_code',
    'IP4:PORT4/run_code'
]
```

Then use the script to train the curriculum agent. This step will be relatively slow due to limitations such as rollout and concurrency restrictions of the sandbox service. So if you would like to change the `max_turns`, please refer to `generate_with_tool_use()` in `curriculum_train/vllm_service_init/start_vllm_server_tool.py`.
```bash
cd curriculum_train/

export STORAGE_PATH=""
export HUGGINGFACENAME=""
export WANDB_API_KEY=""

mkdir -p \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/evaluation" \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/models" \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/generated_question" \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/temp_results"

# Initialize first iteration with base model
bash scripts/curriculum_train.sh Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base qwen3_4b_curriculum_v1
```

### 4. Data Curation
Then we need to construct the training data for the execution agent with filtering mechanism using self-consistency score.
```bash
executor_agent_path=Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base
curriculum_agent_path=${STORAGE_PATH}/models/qwen3_4b_curriculum_v1/global_step_5/actor/huggingface
experiment_name=qwen3_4b_executor_v1

export VLLM_DISABLE_COMPILE_CACHE=1
echo 'start generate question'
bash question_generate/question_generate.bash $curriculum_agent_path 1000 $experiment_name

echo 'start evaluate generated question'
bash question_evaluate/evaluate.sh $executor_agent_path $experiment_name

echo 'start upload'
LOCAL_DATA_PATH=$(python question_evaluate/upload.py --max_score 0.8 --min_score 0.3 --experiment_name ${experiment_name})
echo "training data saved to: ${LOCAL_DATA_PATH}"
```

### 5. Train the Executor Agent
Lastly, we implement the ADPO algorithm in `executor_train/verl_tool/trainer/ppo/core_algos.py` and then update the executor agent with multi-turn RL based on [VeRL-Tool](https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool).

```bash
cd ../executor_train

# if out of cuda memory during training, try lower the use_dynamic_bs=False
bash examples/train/math_tir/train_qwen3_4b_adpo.sh
```

The checkpoints will be saved in `checkpoints/torl`. So you can manually select the checkpoint and train the next iterations.
