## 📖 Overview

The **Agent0 Series** explores a new direction for autonomous agent development, showing that capable agents can improve and evolve without relying on human-curated datasets or handcrafted supervision. This repository brings together two complementary studies that advance self-improving agents through tool-integrated reasoning.

### 🤖 [Agent0](./Agent0): Self-Evolving Language Agents
**Unleashing Self-Evolving Agents from Zero Data via Tool-Integrated Reasoning**

A fully autonomous framework that evolves high-performing language agents through multi-step co-evolution and seamless tool integration. Agent0 establishes a symbiotic competition between two agents:
- **Curriculum Agent**: Proposes increasingly challenging frontier tasks
- **Executor Agent**: Learns to solve them using external tools

**Key Results:**
- ✅ **+18%** improvement on mathematical reasoning benchmarks
- ✅ **+24%** improvement on general reasoning benchmarks
- ✅ Zero external data required for training
- ✅ Multi-turn interaction support

### 👁️ [Agent0-VL](./Agent0-VL): Self-Evolving Vision-Language Agents
**Exploring Self-Evolving Agent for Tool-Integrated Vision-Language Reasoning**

A self-evolving vision-language agent that extends the Agent0 paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Agent0-VL incorporates tool usage not only into reasoning but also into self-evaluation and self-repair through a dual-role architecture:
- **Solver**: Performs multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning
- **Verifier**: Generates structured feedback and fine-grained self-rewards

**Key Results:**
- ✅ **+12.5%** average improvement on visual reasoning benchmarks
- ✅ **+7.3%** improvement in test-time scaling performance
- ✅ State-of-the-art among open-source vision-language models
- ✅ Zero external reward for self-evolution

## 🎯 Key Features

### Shared Philosophy
Both Agent0 and Agent0-VL are built on the principle of **zero-data self-evolution**:
- **No Human Annotations**: Completely eliminates dependency on external data or human supervision
- **Tool-Integrated Reasoning**: Leverages external tools to enhance problem-solving capabilities
- **Autonomous Evolution**: Self-generates training data through intelligent exploration
